    This document will try and describe how to construct channel files for the channel plugin
    to PMS.
    Bundled with the plugin there are some channels already but the .ch files are perhaps not that
    human friendly to read so a quick guide to the structure of the files will be given here.

    General note!
    --------------

    * The parser is extremely forgiving for unknown and misspelled keywords. At best it will inform
      you that there is something wrong by logging it, but most of the time it will probably just
      ignore the faulty word and continue.
    * The files are line based. It is not possible to split long configurations on more lines then
      one since the parser reads one line at a time.
    * If a line starts (after removing leading whitespace chars like space and tab) is #
      that line is removed. This is used for comments. NOTE! That you can only have complete lines
      as comments. You can't have the # at the end or in the middle of a line, if a # is placed
      anywhere else then first on the line it is considered to be part of the line.
    * Empty lines are simply ignored

    Textual conventions
    --------------------

    The following textual conventions are used in this document.
    * <xxx> is an indication that some user defined text should be placed there. The <> should not
      be part of the string (unless you want them to be part of it).
    * [xxx] is an indication that the text is optional, again the [] should be removed.
    *[<xxx>] is thus an indication an optional user defined text.
    * xxx|yyy means that either xxx or yyy is allowed, other values are ignored.
    * Text without <> are keywords and must be written exactly as in this document.
    * Keywords are not case sensitive (all other text is).
    * The words keyword and tag will be used in this document to represent the same thing.

    High level file structure
    --------------------------

    The channels that the plugin will display are placed in "channel files" (or .ch files).
    The plugin is configured with a path where it will read (and parse) all .ch files it finds in
    that directory. This allows you do separate the channels in to smaller files which are easier
    to debug and read. There is however nothing that prevents you from have more than one channel
    per .ch file.
    The .ch file should follow the following structure:

    [version=<ver tag>]
    channel <channelname> {
       <channel block>
    }
    macrodef <macroname> {
       <macro block>
    }

    At the top level there are three (3) configuration elements (version,macrodef,channel). These
    elements does not need to come in any specific order and there are no limit to how many times
    they can be present within a file. However, a channel and a macro can only be defined one
    time (that is the channelname and macroname can only be used once) and if it is defined again
    it will update the old definition.

    Version tag
    -------------
    Each .ch file can contain a version tag. The version tag is a string that is used by the plugin
    to be displayed in the PMS log when the .ch file is parsed. It is not used by the plugin in any
    other way and should be used as a debug aid for the user to see that it is the correct version
    of the file that has been loaded. A good practice is to set the version at the top of the file.

    Channel definition
    -------------------
    A channel is the top most entity you can configure that will be seen on the XMB (under the
    "Channels" folder). The channel definition structure:

    channel <name> {
       [format=audio|video]
       [img=<url to image>]
       <block def, see below>
    }

    The channel name MUST be unique. If the same channel is configured more than once the "last"
    configuration will be the one that is the one that is used.

    The channel has two (2) properties that can be set.
    * format is the format of the data that this channel contains. Can be "audio" or "video",
      the default value is video.
    * The img tag is an URL to a nice image that represents the channel. This will be distributed
      by the PMS as thumbnail for the channel.
    * There must be at least on block definition (or macro usage) in the channel.

    Macro definition
    -----------------
    Macros are configuration that you probably need to use more than once in your file and you don't
    want to copy it to much. A macro is just there to make the .ch file become more readable. A macro
    could be defined anywhere in the file and used anywhere in the file. The macros are however bound
    to one .ch file. This means that as soon as on .ch file has been completely processed all macros
    that were defined in it will be forgotten. Thus, if a macro should be used for more then one channel
    the channels and the macro must be placed in the same .ch file.
    The macro definition structure:

    macrodef <name> {
       <block def, see below>
    }

    Block definition
    -----------------
    The block definition defines the folder structure for the channel. That is how the cahnnel
    is divided in folders and where it finds the media etc. All blocks follow the same skeleton
    structure that can be stated as:
    block keyword {
       block parameters
       more blocks
    }

    The block parameters don't have to come first in the block but it is a good practice to place them
    first. There is no order between the parameters.

    There are three type of blocks defined:
    folder,item and media.

    Folder definition
    ------------------
    A folder is well a folder. It contains other folders and/or media. The folder definition:
    folder {
       [name=<name string>]
       [matcher=<match expression>]
       [url=<url to fetch page from>]
       [type=atz|empty|normal]
       [order=<see order def, below>]
       [prop=<properties>]
       [macro=<name of macro>]   
       [folder {}]
       [item {}]
       [media {}]
    }

    The parameters for a folder are:
    * name - a descriptive name of the folder. Not needed for normal folder since the name should
      come from the matching.
    * matcher - a regular expression matching out entries from the channel. See the matching section
      below for details.
    * order - the order of how things are matched. See the matching section.
    * url - the base url of the folder.
    * type - type of folder. Defaults to normal.
           * ATZ gives folders named A-Z and then sorts all matches on the page according to starting
             letter.
           * ATZLink similar to ATZ but with the difference that the A-Z objects are 
             not found on a single page but already sorted. The plugin will append
             the letters A-Z to the URL. For example if 
             url=http://www.icefilms.info/tv/a-z then the plugin will search for data
             under http://www.icefilms.info/tv/a-z/A,http://www.icefilms.info/tv/a-z/B etc.  
           * empty - the folder is just a placeholder for retrieving the next url.
           * normal - a normal folder.
    * prop - special properties for the folder. See the properties section.
    * macro - use the macro with the specified name. This means that the macro definition
      in reality is pasted in place of the macro line.

    Item definition
    -----------------
    Items are objects which holds media. Normally they are simple palceholders but they can
    hold substantial data as well.
    The item definition:
    item {
       [name=<name string>]
       [matcher=<match expression>]
       [url=<url to fetch page from>]
       [order=<see order def, below>]
       [prop=<properties>]
       [macro=<name of macro>]   
       [media {}]
    }

    NOTE! That an item can only hold media and not other items or folder.
    The parameters of items have the same meaning as those of folders.

    Media definition
    ------------------
    Media is the end result of the channel. This is the actual media stream that will be played.
    The media definition
    media {
       [name=<name string>]
       matcher=<match expression>
       url=<url to fetch page from>
       [order=<see order def, below>]
       [prop=<properties>]
       [macro=<name of macro>]   
       [type=asx|normal]
    }

    The parameters of media has the same meaning as those of item and folder. The type parameter can
    be set to asx to indicate that the media stream found is an asx file which needs some special
    treatment by the plugin.

    Matching
    ---------
    The whole purpose of the plugin is to present the web based channels (like SVTPlay) and allow
    you browse the programs and finally play the media. This is done via some matching on the various
    web pages that the play channel provides. This matching is done using regexps. If you need
    to brush up your regexp skills go to google and do some searching.
    The matcher parameter contains the regexp used to match out the relevant data for a particular
    object (folder,item,media). The matching can produce three types of information to the plugin:
    url,name and thumbnail. At a minimum a url must be produced, the name and the thumbnail picture
    can be excluded. A name is normally also needed since it is hard to find the show you want
    if all have no name. This production of data is used regexp "groups" (="()"). Which group in
    a match expression that is the url,name or thumb is controlled by the order parameter.

    The order is a comma separated list with the names name,url,thumb in the correct order and
    combination. A keyword can occur more than once and if that is the case it will be concatenated
    with the rest of the same sort.

    The matched url is then concatenated with the url parameter to produce a url which corresponds
    to the next page where new matches will be made.

    Example:
    matcher=<a href=\"([^\"]+)\">([^<]+)</a>
    order=url,name
    url=http://mysite.com/here

    This is a very normal matcher. It matches expressions of form <a href="xxxx">yyyy</a>. It
    produces two results the first (=xxxx) will be the url part and the second (=yyyy) is the
    name. The matched url (=xxxx) will then be appended to the url parameter and the resulting url
    (=http://mysite.com/here/xxxx) will be used for the next object as start page. A folder
    (or item or media) will be visible on the XMB with the name yyyy.

    If the last object in the order list ends with a "+" sign (for example name+) it means that all
    the remaining matched groups are of that type.

    Example:
    matcher=<a href=\"([^\"]+)\">([^<]+)</a>\<\"([^\"]+)\"
    order=url,name+
    url=http://mysite.com/here

    If the url parameter is left out the matched url part (=xxxx in the example) is considered to
    be a full url.

    Properties
    -----------
    Each object (=folder,item or media) can have some extra properties set to them. The properties
    are added (just like order) as a comma separated list. Some properties have a value which
    is then specified as <proerty name>=<property value>. The value part is left out for many
    properties. The list of properties:

    * url_separator
      name_separator
      thumb_separator:
      These three properties all take a value (that is =<value>) and this controls what should be used
      when concatenating multiple matched parts of theat type. For example name_separator=: means
      that if we have two matched groups for name, say a and b, the resulting name will be a:b.
     
    * auto_media: The item equivalent of an empty folder. This means that the item will autamtically
      fetch the next page which the should contain the media.
     
    * prepend_url
      prepend_name
      prepend_thumb:
      If a value is given the value will be prepended to the matched data (url,name or thumb).
      
    * append_url
      append_name
      append_thumb:
      If a value is given the value will be appended to the matched data (url,name or thumb).
      
    * ignore_name: If a name parameter is given it will be used in stead of the matched one. This
      will also be the case when no name match is found.
      
    * use_conf_thumb: If a thumb url is configured it will be used instead of a matched one.
    
    * other_string: Used for ATZLink to set the "other" folder string. By default this is "#".

    Magic token
    -------------
    Some rtmp streams needs to be played by rtmpdump by the use of the -y option. Tó solve this issue
    a special url_separator should be used. If the url_separator is !!!pms_ch_dash_y!!! it will
    be replace by -y just before given to rtmpdump.

    Sample file
    -----------
    1. version=0.1
    2. channel SVTPlay {
    3.   img=http://svtplay.se/img/brand/svt-play.png
    4.   folder {
    5.      name=A-Z
    6.      type=ATZ
    7.      url=http://svtplay.se/alfabetisk
    8.      folder {
    9.          matcher=<a href=\"(/t/.*)\">(.*)</a>
    10.          order=url,name
    11.          url=http://svtplay.se
    12.           item {
    13.            url=http://svtplay.se
    14.              matcher=<a href=\"(/v/.*)\?.*\" title=\"(.*)\" .*?>[^<]*<img class=\"thumbnail\" src=\"([^\"]+)\"
    15.              order=url,name,thumb
    16.              prop=auto_media
    17.            media {
    18.                 matcher=url:(rtmp.*),bitrate:2400
    19.            }
    20.         }
    21.      }
    22.    }
    23. }
    The number on the left hand side should not be there and are just ther to make it simple to
    walktrough the file in this explanation.
    Line 1. A simple version line, the version is 0.1 here.
    Line 2. We start defining a channel with the name SVTPlat.
    Line 3. We set an img URL which shows some nice picture.
    (Note that no format is set so it will be video by default)
    Line 4. Start defineing a folder, this will be on the top level.
    Line 5. The folder name is A-Z
    Line 6. This is an A to Z folder and the plugin will insert the A-Z folders and sort
    the matched dat in the correct folder.
    Line 7. The URL where this folder should fetch it's pag from is set here.
    Line 8-20. Defines a subfolder.
    Line 9-10. We matches an url and a name. If this is found on the page:
    <a href="/t/102532/a-ekonomi">A-ekonomi</a>
    Then the matched url is /t/102532/a-ekonomi and the matched name is A-ekonomi.
    Line 11. The url part for the match is set here. When combined with the matched url the
    resulting URL will be http://svtplay.se/t/102532/a-ekonomi.
    Line 13-20. Define an item.
    Line 14. A matcher that produces an url a name and a thumbnail. The matched url will be of
    form /v/xxxx and a resulting URL will be http://svtplay.se/v/xxxx.
    Line 16. The proerty auto_media is used to indicate that this item is just placeholder were
    the real media stream url is found.
    Line 17-19. Defines a media.
    Line 18. This will produce a full rtmp:// url. Since SVTPly has more then one rtmp-stream
    per program we add some matching to only select on (the one with the best bitrate).
    Line 19-23. Just end }

    Hopefully you can now make your own .ch files (or modify the existing once). If you do there
    are most likely other people that wants to view that channel as well so please publish your
    channel files on the PMS forum.
